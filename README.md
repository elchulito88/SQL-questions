# das42 SQL Questions

The answers to the following questions have been provided in this repository.
Each answered question has an SQL file attached to run in Looker.
There's also a formatted excel table with the output for each SQL query.

1. How many customers (users) are there in the dataset?

2. QA the prior result. Any issue with duplicate entries?

3. Provide a report that shows order status and a count of how many orders
have each status. Answers should be in a single table.

4. Provide an ordered report of the the top 100 customers as determined by
total dollar amount sold. Include the first name, last name, user_id,
and total dollars spent. Hint: we only want uncancelled and unreturned
values counted. BONUS: format the results nicely (i.e. with a dollar
sign and to two decimal places.)

5. What is the brand and item_name of the most expensive product for each
category type? Are there any ties? Does anything concern you about
these results?
